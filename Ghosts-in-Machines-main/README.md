## Symcheck Chatbot
The symptom checker chatbot, developed using Python and Flask, is a sophisticated tool aimed at aiding users in identifying potential health conditions based on their reported symptoms. Leveraging a blend of cutting-edge technologies and algorithms, it efficiently processes user input to deliver accurate responses. Flask streamlines the creation of a user-friendly web interface, enabling seamless interaction with the chatbot. Behind the scenes, Python scripts drive the logic for symptom analysis and disease identification. The primary goal of this tool is to enhance convenience and minimize the time required for individuals to address minor illnesses or discomforts, empowering them to make informed health decisions promptly.

### How it Works ?
Frontend: The frontend of the symptom checker chatbot project involves designing a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Flask serving as the backend API provider. HTML provides the structure of the web pages, while CSS styles them for a visually appealing look. JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling features such as form validation and dynamic content updates. Flask routes requests from the frontend to the appropriate backend functions for processing, ensuring a seamless user experience. The frontend design prioritizes simplicity and clarity, guiding users through the symptom input process and presenting the results in an easily understandable format.

Backend: In the backend of the symptom checker chatbot project, Python and Flask work cooperatively to process user input and generate accurate health assessments. Flask handles incoming requests from the frontend, directing them to Python functions responsible for symptom analysis and disease identification. Upon receiving symptom data from the user via the frontend interface, Python's natural language processing capabilities, possibly utilizing libraries like Pandas,sklearn.utils,flask,flask.cors, dissect the input to extract pertinent keywords and patterns. These extracted symptoms are then compared against a comprehensive database of medical conditions and associated symptoms. Utilizing advanced algorithms, the backend logic identifies potential diseases that align with the user-reported symptoms. Alongside disease names, additional details such as common symptoms, treatment options, and preventative measures can be fetched from the database or external APIs. Flask manages the seamless flow of information between the frontend and backend, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience. This backend system is meticulously crafted to deliver reliable and timely health insights, aiding users in making informed decisions about their well-being.

### Technologies used
Python(Flask)
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

### How to configure
In our project the user will provide symptoms of their illness or dicomfort as a Yes or No answer where the questions are provided by the system based on the database.When all symptoms matchhes to a diseasee then the system will the disease name,treatment details and other details about the disease.

### How to Run
The running of the software based on comparing the details fo symptoms provided by the user and the existing dataset present in the Kaggle website.By this comparison off the information we reach into a conclusion where the disease name ,details about the disease will be specified.
